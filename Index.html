                A flower, also known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the
                division Angiospermae). Flowers consist of a combination of vegetative organs – sepals that enclose and protect the
                developing flower. These petals attract pollinators, and reproductive organs that produce gametophytes, which in
                flowering plants produce gametes. The male gametophytes, which produce sperm, are enclosed within pollen grains produced
                in the anthers. The female gametophytes are contained within the ovules produced in the ovary

                Most flowering plants depend on animals, such as bees, moths, and butterflies, to transfer their pollen between
                different flowers, and have evolved to attract these pollinators by various strategies, including brightly colored,
                conspicuous petals, attractive scents, and the production of nectar, a food source for pollinators. In this way, many
                flowering plants have co-evolved with pollinators to be mutually dependent on services they provide to one another—in
                the plant's case, a means of reproduction; in the pollinator's case, a source of food.

                When pollen from the anther of a flower is deposited on the stigma, this is called pollination. Some flowers may
                self-pollinate, producing seed using pollen from a different flower of the same plant, but others have mechanisms to
                prevent self-pollination and rely on cross-pollination, when pollen is transferred from the anther of one flower to the
                stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species. Self-pollination happens in flowers where the
                stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower's stigma. This
                pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators.[3] Some
                flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops
                into fruit containing seeds.
